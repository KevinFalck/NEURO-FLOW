# NEURO-FLOW
> **"Focus Re-imagined."**

### The Problem
In a world of infinite distraction, your attention is the most valuable currency. You don't need another productivity app. You need a **State of Mind**.

### The Solution
We didn't just build a game. We built a **Neuro-Adaptive Engine**.
One single HTML file. No dependencies. No loading times. Just pure, unadulterated **Flow**.

## ⚡ Core Technologies

### 🧠 Neuro-Adaptive Audio Engine
This isn't music. It's **Auditory Architecture**.
*   **Brown Noise layering** isolates your cortex from external chaos.
*   **Procedural 90BPM Pulse** anchors your biological clock.
*   **Evolutionary Synthesis** that grows richer as your focus deepens.
*   *Built entirely with the Web Audio API. Zero assets.*

### 🌌 Hyper-Focus Visuals
We stripped away the noise.
*   **Geometric Precision**: Every pixel serves a purpose.
*   **Dynamic Vignette**: As you enter Flow, the world fades away. Only the objective remains.
*   **Retinal Magnetism**: Targets don't just appear; they are pulled into your orbit.

### 🕹️ One-File Architecture
*   **Zero Install**: It runs everywhere. Even on a toaster (if it has a browser).
*   **Clean Code**: A masterclass in Vanilla JS engineering.
*   **60 FPS Guaranteed**: Optimized for the speed of thought.
